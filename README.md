<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>
    This is a small selection of the projects that I created in class while attending the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA). Enjoy!
  
  <ul>
    <li>Math App
      <ul> This is a simple Windows Form Application that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers that the user inputs. This was actually the first Windows Form Application that I ever created!</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Task Tracker
      <ul> Console Application that a user can use to create, view, and delete tasks. Upon running the application, a folder is created in the user's drive that will store these tasks.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Moon Miner
      <ul> A Windows Form game! Mine various resources from different planets and sell them at the Galactic Trade Federation. Buy 10 ships to win, but look out for the Resource Jackers along the way! Some of them are a bit greedy... This was a group project developed in a 14 day sprint. </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
