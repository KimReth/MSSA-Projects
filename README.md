# MSSA Projects
This is a collection of projects that I've created while attending MSSA. Enjoy!

MathApp:
This is a simple Windows Form Application that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers that the user inputs.
This was actually the first Windows Form Application that I ever created!


TaskTracker:
Console Application that a user can use to create, view, and delete tasks. Upon running the application, a folder is created in the user's drive that will store these tasks.


MoonMiner:
A windows form game called "Moon Miner". This was a group project developed in a 14 day sprint. 


Cheers!
