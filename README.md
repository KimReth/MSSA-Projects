# MSSA Projects
This is a collection of projects that I've created. Enjoy!

MathApp:
This is a simple Windows Form Application that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers that the user inputs.
This was actually the first Windows Form Application that I ever created!


TaskTracker:
Console Application that a user can use to create and view tasks. Upon running the application, a folder is created in the user's drive that will store these tasks.
